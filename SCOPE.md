### Overview
A simple portfolio display using Bootstrap and jQuery, hosted on Heroku. 

### Specifications
There will be both prose and poetry available. Poetry will be displayed 3 columns at a time, and prose displayed taking up the entire width of the container.

All writing will have a title, date, and body content to display.

A background image will be added to make the site look pretty, and a theme from Bootswatch will be chosen.

### Amendment 1
A decent background image could not be found; however, the site has been approved by the developer's neighbor Kelly. On her recommendation, instead of a background image, the color of the headers will change colors gradually.

Social media links will be added to the header.
