his eyes shine from over the black whorls of his cheeks
and the thin orchid-petals over his eyebrows. his poet’s
leaves are painted purple; they glow softly with the
pollen from his nightmares. i have never seen him so
close to death, so close to his dreams.

he never shares his dreams with me. when i ask he just
smiles, his lips pressed thin and the grove humming
between his fingertips and mine. a firefly circles the
lantern we are using to silence the darkness. he holds
my icy hands without a word. on the darkest nights,
when rain falls in slick sheets over the tree canopy
and collects in the pool at the bottom of the grove, he
asks me to sleep with him. it is as innocent a request
as it could possibly be--which is to say, not at all. i think
sometimes the nightmares are his way of flirting, his
own unique foreplay, but he assures me they are all
pain. that the suffering he tastes in the back of his throat
isn’t just my honey or my sap.

his head rests against the crook of my neck, his lips
slightly open in his sleep. he has never been more
beautiful than when he is dreaming, when his shoulders
rise and fall. his hands press into my back, the soft
petals of his fingertips against hard, icy wood. he is
like a panther, sleek and limber, a soft coat of fur dusted
with starlight from the luminescent grove. he lays
against the snowy deeps of my chest.

i want to cry every time he wakes up screaming.
