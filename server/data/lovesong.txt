crack.
	crumble.

the old concrete ruins like broken nails the
metal screaming, torn veins bleeding out
on the sidewalk

i breathe in decaying iron

doves’ bodies litter the edge
	where the deep green grass
	curls over
and chokes
the metal grates
until they are silent

last night i had a dream that i burned to death
and left behind a perfect corpse

the curve of her lips twitched in anticipation
i looked over her broken body
and said
	you don’t really look like me

her lips
	cracked
	crumbled
	fell open

she breathed out words like
	torn veins
	bleeding out on the sidewalk
her throat rough and red
she breathed out words like
	torn veins
	bleeding out on the sidewalk
her throat rough and red

i fed her doves’ eyes from a cocktail glass
ringed with silver crosses

it spilled clear liquid onto the ground
and mixed
with the blood
	like colored oil

the grass soaked it in
tasting blood at the root
it wanted more
it strangled the metal grates
and asked me
to cut my arms
open		to bleed

so i knelt down and drew a line
over her pale flesh

she smiled
her lips cracked
	breathed
in
and out

she was a messy corpse
but her nails were perfect
	i broke them
	one
	by one
		she watched me with
		glassy doves’ eyes
		big and innocent

i slit open her throat
	she gurgled and said

“i would like to hold you closer”
“i love you”
“my pretty dove”
